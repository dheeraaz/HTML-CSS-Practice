# HTML-CSS-Practice

This repo contains all the UI designs and UI components which I created while practicing the html and css.


## Screenshots

Please open the individual folder, and see for "SS.png" file, which contains the screenshots of UI. 

PS: Almost all the UI components are responsive, that's why I haven't added screenshots showcasing their responsiveness.
